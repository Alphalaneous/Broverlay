**Replaces the use of SceneManager with my custom Broverlay, allowing nodes to sit on top of the screen without affecting the z ordering and touch of those behind them.**

**<cr>MegaHack has a bug that can cause a rare random crash when launching the game with this mod. I cannot fix that on my end.</c>**
